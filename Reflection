Topic: System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary) Industrial Talk 2

I aim to grow into a skilled system developer in four years by combining technical knowledge and 
practical experience. My plan includes learning Python, C++, and databases like PostgreSQL in the first 
year, followed by internships and personal projects in year two. By the third year, I’ll explore technologies 
like cloud services and system design tools, and in the final year, I’ll integrate my skills into large-scale 
projects and prepare for a full-time developer role. 


Topic: BIG DATA AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT NEW INNOVATION

The Design Thinking of BIG DATA AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT NEW INNOVATION has 
taught me the importance of empathy and user-centered approaches in creating solutions for Big Data 
and Artificial Intelligence. I learned how the stages such as Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and 
Test can guide the development of intuitive and impactful technologies. As a software engineering 
student, this knowledge will help me design solutions that are not only technically sound but also 
user-friendly and ethical. In the future, I aim to apply these principles to create meaningful 
technologies that address real-world challenges effectively.
